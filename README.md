Numerical physics simulations in python using pygame 

This repository contains small physics simulations written in Python to explore
classical mechanics concepts through numerical modeling and visualization.

2-body.py: Simulates the motion of two gravitational bodies acting on each other.
circle_in_circle_gravity.py: Simulates the motion of bouncing balls inside a circle. This simulation demonstrates chaos.
colliding_blocks.py: Demonstrates a clever way to compute pi using a physics simulation.
